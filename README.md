# 🌐 Web Scraping Automation Project  
 

---

## 📝 Project Overview  

This project automates the process of web scraping to collect specific data from a target webpage. It:  
- Fetches the **HTML content** of a webpage.  
- Extracts **useful information** such as the page title and all hyperlinks.  
- Saves the scraped data into a **structured text file** for analysis or reuse.  

This project is designed to help beginners and developers learn the fundamentals of web scraping while offering a practical tool for data collection.  

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used  

- **Python**: Core language for scripting.  
- **BeautifulSoup**: Parses and navigates HTML content.  
- **Requests**: Handles HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.

---

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations  

- Always follow the **terms of service** of the websites you scrape.  
- Avoid scraping websites that explicitly disallow it in their `robots.txt`.  
- Use scraping responsibly to avoid server overload or legal issues.  

---

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting  

- **Network Errors**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and the URL is accessible.  
- **Empty Output**: Double-check the webpage structure; it might have changed or use dynamic content (e.g., JavaScript).
